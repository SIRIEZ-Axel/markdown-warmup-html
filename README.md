### A funny story
My story happened the day before this code, I was hanging with friends when one of us wanted to go looking for something at the house of his friend. It was supposed to be close to us, like 2 or 3 streets way. Finally it took us maybe 45 minutes to find him!! Just because he was drunk so he couldn't tell us his adress. Our driver was so angry going around, his face turned red like a tomato.

### TL;DR
It is a story of friends going around.
